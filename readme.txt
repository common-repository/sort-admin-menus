Sorts the items in the "Settings" and "Tools" menus in alphabetical order.

== Description ==

This plugin sorts the items in the "Settings" and "Tools" dashboard menus in alphabetical order. Useful when you have lots of plugins installed and very cluttered menus as a result. The plugin should work well with most "drop-down menu" plugins and other visual enhancements.

You can configure which menus are sorted by editing the source code. Yes, hackety-hack :)  

== Installation ==

To install the plugin follow these steps :

1. Download the sort-admin-menus.zip file to your local machine.
1. Unzip the file 
1. Upload "sort-admin-menus" folder to the "/wp-content/plugins/" directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

That's all. You might need to reload the page before menus will appear sorted.
